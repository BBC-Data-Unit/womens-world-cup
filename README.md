In July 2019 we [produced a map](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-48801235) showing where the England Women's World Cup squad were born. The map showed that the Lionesses were a distinctly northern group, with the majority of the 23-strong squad born in north-west or north-east England or Yorkshire. Not a single player was born in London, the East or the South West of England, with just three born in the South East.
